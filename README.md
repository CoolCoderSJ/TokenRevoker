# TokenRevoker

TokenRevoker is a Discord Bot designed to help keep people safe. Github does automatic token scanning for specific services, and can help revoke your token if leaked. If our bot finds your token on Discord, it creates a file here, which Github scans, alerts the service, and the service revokes your token.
