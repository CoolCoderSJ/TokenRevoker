Hey there!

We've created this file because a token was found on Discord, and needs to be revoked for security reasons.

Guessed Service: Discord

my_secret = os.environ['TOKEN']

    print("bot online") #will print "bot online" in the console when the bot is online

async def ping(ctx):
    await ctx.send("Bing bong fuck ya life") #simple command so that when you type "!ping" the bot will respond with "pong!"

async def kick(ctx, member : discord.Member):
    try:
        await member.kick(reason=JAE RAIDED)
        await ctx.send("kicked "+member.mention) #simple kick command to demonstrate how to get and use member mentions
    except:
        await ctx.send("bot does not have the kick members permission!")


client.run(os.getenv("OTMwNjM3NDMyMTcxNDIxNzc2.Yd4xpg.-1fgGoK3xMxzWnJC-G-idkPLn8E")) #get your bot token and create a key named `TOKEN` to the secrets panel then paste your bot token as the value. 
#to keep your bot from shutting down use https://uptimerobot.com then create a https:// monitor and put the link to the website that appewars when you run this repl in the monitor and it will keep your bot alive by pinging the flask server
#enjoy!
